Introduction: Many astrobiologically significant processes leave traces of their actions as features in the size range 10s to 100s of µm. The Mapping µ-XRF spectrometer (“Map-X”) is intended to provide elemental imaging at ≤100µm spatial resolution, yielding elemental chemistry at or below the scale length where many relict physical, chemical, and biological features can be imaged and interpreted in ancient rocks.  Map-X is an arm-deployed instrument placed directly on the surface of an object to be analyzed [1]. During an analysis, either an x-ray tube or a radioisotope source bombards the sample with x-rays (tube) or α-particles and γ-rays (radioisotope), resulting in x-ray fluorescence from the sample. Fluoresced x-rays pass through a focusing lens (x-ray µ-Pore Optic, “MPO”) that projects a spatially resolved image of the x-rays emitted from the sample onto an x-ray sensitive CCD. The CCD is read at several frames per second so that in most cases, no more than one photon strikes an individual pixel between read cycles. In this way, energies and positions of individual x-ray photons are recorded. In a single 3-hour analysis, several thousand frames are both stored and processed in real-time. Scaling the source to meet science requirements:  The source flux must be scaled to meet the science requirements of the instrument including:  1). singlephoton counting by the CCD and 2). sufficient flux to meet detection limits for minor elements and accuracy/precision limits for major elements. Map-X requirements are based on those stated for the x-ray imaging instrument on the Mars 2020 rover, namely quantitation to ±10% for the major elements Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca and Fe; and detection of minor elements P, S, Cl, K, Ti, Cr, and Mn at the 100 ppm level. We are employing a combination of empirical measurements utilizing an XRF test fixture (Fig. 1), and modeling utilizing the Monte Carlo program XMIMSIM [2] to determine source flux requirements. Empirical tests:  The XRF test fixture was fabricated to study fluorescence from 30 mm diameter flat samples made from pressed powders of known mineral and rock compositions.  Spectra are collected in air or under vacuum using either tube or radioisotope sources.  The tube source has an Au anode, and is operated at 30 KeV, 20-100 µA.   We have evaluated two radioisotope sources, 30mCi 55Fe (γ = 5.89 KeV) and 30mCi 241Am (γ = 14 KeV, 18 KeV and 60 KeV). Additional tests are planned using a 252Cf thin foil αparticle source.  Test spectra were analyzed with the spectral fitting and analysis program PYMCA [3].    Fig. 1, XRF test fixture showing sample holder, radioisotope source, Amtek SDD detector and stage to hold either normal collimation or an X-ray MPO. Comparisons were made of spectra collected with normal collimation in place or with the MPO in place, to determine the attenuation produced by the MPO. Fig. 2 compares spectra collected from a basalt standard with and without the MPO. The attenuation caused by the MPO (after removing absorption due to a Mylar film that is part of the MPO used for this measurement) ranges from ~1-3 for Na to ~18-20 for Fe.   Modeling:  We have not tested all of the radioisotope sources under consideration for the Map-X instrument; we are using XMIMSIM to explore possible x-ray source combinations. XMIMSIM calculates xray fluorescence from a variety of sources including xray tubes and/or specified radioisotopes. X-rays from the source interact with sample electrons via the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering and Rayleigh scattering, and K, L, and M lines are simulated.   Using the test fixture shown in Fig. 1, we compared XMIXSIM simulations with empirical results for a variety of sources and samples.  Using a 30mCi 55Fe source we have examined basalt, dolomite, gypsum, and obsidian samples. A comparison of lab and simulation spectra for the basalt standard, fluoresced by the 30mCi 55Fe source measured (in air) is shown in Fig. 3.  The agreement is quite good for higher energy peaks, and similar agreement is seen for the other three samples. For the 241Am source there is a high background at low energies, due to bremsstrahlung from highly energetic Compton electrons produced inside the sample by 1829.pdf

the 241Am γ-line at 59.5 keV [4]. For this reason we now consider 244Cm (γ = 11 KeV and 19 KeV) for our radioisotope source in flight- and proto-flight Map-X instruments. Two configurations are under consideration: 1), a combination of sealed 244Cm (no αemission) plus 55Fe sources, and 2), 244Cm sources covered by thin Ti foils, yielding γ-ray and α-particle fluorescence, as are used in the APXS instruments [5].    Fig. 2, Comparison of XRF spectra of NIST Basalt 288 obtained with normal detector collimation (blue) and with an xray MPO in place (red).  The sample was covered with a Pb foil having a 6 mm dia opening in the center, to limit the fluorescence to the same area of the sample for both collimator and MPO.  Fig. 3, An XRF spectrum of NIST Basalt 288 using a 30mCi 55Fe γ-source measured (in air) in the lab test fixture is shown in blue. The corresponding XMIMSIM simulation result for this sample is shown in red. For tube sources the excitation spectrum can be modeled with XMIMSIM using either the Ebel model [6], or a measured energy spectrum. If we normalize simulation results to lab results by matching Au scattering peaks, the sim/lab ratios are too high for Fe (by factor of ~2) but decrease as Z decreases (and are a factor of ~10 too low for Al, Na). We are still trying to understand this drop-off in sim/lab ratios at lower Z.  Source requirement development:  Baseline requirements for elemental chemistry are to measure Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe to ±10%, if present at >1000 ppm, and to detect P, S, Cl, K, Ti, Cr, Mn (at 2σ significance) if present at >100 ppm. Here we assume integration over a sample area of 2cm x 2cm and an accumulation time of 10000 seconds. We calculate the significance level k = !!!!∗!!" for a characteristic peak (usually 𝐾𝛼) of  element i,  where N!= # counts above background in the peak;  n!"= # of MCA channels under peak; h!= height of background at location of peak. So, for detection at significance 2σ one would like k ≥ 2 .  For quantitation, one wants k to be of order 10.  Table 1 shows results for k in a basalt-like matrix (15%  Fe, 27% Si, 11%Al, 47% O) using  Cm244 (6 x 30mCi) sources +  Fe55 (6 x 30mCi) sources, assuming 10000 sec accumulation time.

If we take the simulation results at face value, all the science requirements are met except for Na, Mg, P. We plan to test a 252Cf foil source in the lab, to see to what extent α-particle fluorescence could improve fluorescence yields at low Z.   If these results are encouraging, we will consider 244Cm sources similar to those utilized in the APXS instrument [5,7].
