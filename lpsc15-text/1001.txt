In this contribution we provide an analysis of three low domes located to the north of Aristarchus region near crater Wollaston, termed W1-3 (Fig.1 and Table 1). The lavas of the examined mare domes are characterized by low R415/R750 (reddish lavas) indicating a low TiO2 content (Table 3).  Fig. 1.

Morphometric dome properties: Based on the telescopic CCD image (Fig. 1) we obtained a DEM of the examined domes by applying the combined photoclinometry and shape from shading method (sfs) described in [1-3]. The heights of the domes W1-3 were determined to 53, 55 and 40 m, resulting in flank slopes of 1.0°, 0.64° and 0.54°, respectively (Fig. 2 and 3). Assuming a parabolic shape the estimated edifice volumes correspond to about 1.1, 3.2 and 1.2 km 3 for three examined domes W1-W3. We also estimated the height of W1 based on shadow length measurements in the oblique illumination view shown in Fig. 1, where a value of 50 m was computed according to lunar topographic orthophotomap LTO 39A1.

GLD100 dataset: Scholten et al. present a nearly global lunar DEM with a grid size of 100 m, the socalled GLD100 [4]. This DEM has been constructed based on photogrammetric analysis of LROC WAC image pairs. ACT-REACT Quick Map tool was used to access to the GLD100 dataset, allowing to obtain the cross-sectional profiles and the corresponding 3D view (Fig. 4), in agreement with the results obtained with photoclinometry and sfs applied to telescopic image.      According to the classification scheme for lunar domes introduced in [1, 3], and based on a principal component analysis (PCA), the domes W2 and W3 belong to class C1. On the contrary, W1 belongs to class E2.

Cross-sectional profile in east-west direction derived from the telescopic image for the domes W1(top), W2 (middle) and W3 (bottom). The vertical axis is 10 times exaggerated.      Rheologic properties: The rheologic model developed in [5], which relies on the morphometric dome properties, yelds estimates of the lava viscosity η, the  effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion process for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morphometric values listed in Table 1, we obtained rheologic properties for the examined domes (Table 2).     The dome W1 is characterised by a moderate lava viscosity of 10 4 Pa s, while for W2 and W3 we have inferred lava viscosities of ~10 3 Pa s computed based on a lava density of 2800 kg m -3 . The domes formed over a period of time of about 0.3 years (W1 and W2) and 0.16 years (W3).  According to the model developed in [6], we estimated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L). For three domes we found magma rise speeds of the order 10 -3 -10 -4 m s -1 and dike lengths of 16-32 km. The inferred dike widths amount to 9 m, 4 m and 3.5 m for W1, W2 and W3, respectively. With its rheologic properties and dike dimension, W1 is a typical representative of the rheologic group R1 introduced in [1, 3], while the domes W2 and W3 belongs to group R2 due to their lower lava viscosity.
